# TateDecoder: Unmask the JSON Matrix 🗂️  

Ever wondered what secrets are hidden in the depths of *The Real World* leaks? Look no further! **TateDecoder** takes the jumbled mess of JSON files from Andrew Tate’s social media scam and helps to convert them into a cleaner, more readable format. It’s simple, it’s slow as hell because I wrote it myself, and it won’t try to sell you a course on “escaping the Matrix.”  

## What’s This All About?  

Let’s be real: this tool isn’t going to free you from the Matrix, but it *will* make sense of messy JSON files from the leaks. Use it to:  

- Get clarity on what’s actually in the leaks.  
- Laugh at the absurdity of it all.  
- Educate yourself on shady internet scams.  

### Important Notice  

The actual leaked JSON files are **not included** in this repository. You’ll need to obtain those files yourself if you want to use TateDecoder. This project only provides the tools to process and decode them.
